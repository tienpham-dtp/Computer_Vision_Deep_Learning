This project consists of 4 parts:
Data used: Caltech-UCSD Bird 200 dataset
1. Perform image classification using machine learning and deep learning methods like:
  a) Logistic Regression
  b) Feedforward Network
  c) CNN
2. Perform Transfer Learning with pretrained ResNet
3. Experiment with Convolution Auto-enconder and Variational Autoencoder
4. Experiment with GAN
